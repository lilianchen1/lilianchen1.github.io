        <h2>Brief Personal History</h2>
        <p>
          I went to the <span class="mit">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, where I studied Biology.
          I am a nerd when it comes to immunology. I took an intro to CS class at MIT and
          it was one of the most challenging but fulfilling and interesting
          classes I've ever taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from MIT, I moved to San Francisco. Here, my life and my
          career journey took a 180 degree turn, and IT IS AWESOME! I am passionate about
          and excited by Web Development. I have to say, moving to SF and attending
          App Academy are some of the biggest and possibly most impactful decisions of
          my life.
        </p>
