        <h2>Brief Personal History</h2>
        <p>
          I went to <span>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span>, where I studied Biology.
          I think I have a fairly solid understanding of molecular/cell biology; my
          background is in immunology.
        </p>
        <p>
          After graduating from MIT, I moved to San Francisco. Here, my life and my
          career journey took a 180 degree turn, and IT IS AWESOME!
        </p>
