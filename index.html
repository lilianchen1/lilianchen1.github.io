          <p>Viral Destruction is inspired by the classic Asteroids Game.
             In this rendition, the asteroids are nasty viruses, the ship
             is a white blood cell (B lymphocype), and the bullets are
             antibodies that will target the viruses and lead to
             their destruction!</p>
